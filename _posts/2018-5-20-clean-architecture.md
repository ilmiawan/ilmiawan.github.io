What is a good architect's design look like? In a highest level of design the architecture should show the intent. When we see the design of a building, we would instantly know what the building is made for. Independently the design shown the purpose and functionality of the products. But this is not what happened in many of the Software Designs. 

Rather than showing what the intent of the products will be, most of the architectural design in software projects is dictated by their frameworks. At first the frameworks is just some form of libraries that would help speed up the deliverance of a project development. Through the time, now frameworks becoming the center of every projects development architecture. In Java for example, spring frameworks has become the centre of every java project development. Many projects depends highly on these frameworks, that even a slight change in the frameworks affecting the development process of the project. The project is become vunerable to development of the frameworks itself.
